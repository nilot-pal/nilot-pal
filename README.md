# Hi there!

## üöÄ About Me

üéì I am Nilotpal Chakraborty, a **2nd year PhD student of Engineering Mechanics** at **Virginia Tech**. I am working in the **Laboratory of Transport Phenomena for Advanced Technologies**, supervised by **Dr. Rui Qiao**(https://me.vt.edu/people/faculty/qiao-rui.html). I plan to graduate in late 2026. Prior to this, I earned a BS degree in Mechanical Engineering (first class with distinction) from NIT Tiruchirappalli, India, in 2020.

üë®‚Äçüíª I have been doing research on Computational Fluid Dynamics since my undergraduate. Some of the projects I've worked on required use of commercial codes which I really enjoyed at first. However, as the problems I was working on got more novel and complex, I started writing my own code. That is when I realized that I was enjoying programming, as it is very close to math, my favorite subject. In 2020, I interned at **IIT Madras** working on extending features of **FEST3D**, an opensource computational fluid dynamic solver written in Fortran 90 for solving the Navier-Stokes equations on structured grids using state-of-the-art finite-volume methods. Apart from writing code for my academic projects, I got my first opportunity to write production level code when working at **Zeus Numerix**, a company specializing in defense applications. There, I got familiar with software design, OOP in C++ and version control. I never looked back ever since. Since the start of my PhD in 2022, I've made sure I enrolled in at least one programming-intensive course every semester. This has helped me build strong foundations in OOP, software design and ML apart from the following languages: **Fortran, C++, Java, Python, C and MATLAB**. Because my PhD requires me to present my ideas to the audience most of the time, I've developed a habit of spending a lot of time preparing for my presentations. This led me to this idea of making a portfolio website for myself where I can paint a broader picture of what I do. I recently started contributing to **Open Source Projects** and have contributed to two, **SPHinXsys** and **awesome-portfolio-websites**. I am really enthusiastic about learning new technologies like Machine Learning and Quantum Computing.

‚úàÔ∏è Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. I am an avid traveller, having travelled throughout India and some places in North America. 

üìö I make it a point reading books on **personal development** & **financial literacy**. My favorite ones are **The Bhagawat Gita** in the genre of personal development and **Rich Dad Poor Dad** by _Robert Kiyosaki_ in the genre of financial literacy.
